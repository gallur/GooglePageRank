# Google PageRank Algorithm Using Hadoop+MapReduce

### When Google first came up with the algorithm to rank web pages based on certain criterion like number of backlinks a website gets from other reknowed websites, they knew that this was a big data problem. Me, personally being extremely interested in search engine optimization algorithms, was intrigued to take on a project emulating the same.

### This algorithm makes use of the fact that you can land on a page in one of only two ways - either you access the webpage directly or you access it using some link on another page. The pagerank of a page is shared between the pages that it links to.

### Based on prior tests, a person would land directly on a page about 15% of the time but 85% of time, they would come from a different link.

### The mapper for the algo takes input in the form of (Site, PR, Neighbors) and yields Site, Neighbors.
